<h1>Punchy Grave Jam Prep</h1>
<h2>good stuff to know</h2>
There are two seperate files that can be played
<br>
- main_3d
<br>
- main_2d
<br>
those contain the test enviornment for the 3d and 2d respectively.
<br>
Each can be run by doing the following:
<br>
- navigating to the tab
<br>
- right clicking the desired tab
<br>
- selecting "play this scene"
<br>
<br>
...you can also just play the main_3d by selecting the play button as normal...
<br>
<h3>
  3D Scene
</h3>
Controls:
<br>
-wasd
<br>
-mouse (click on window with mouse)
<br>
<br>
<p>
  Ok so there is this thing in the script for the 3d player controls where if you set the player3d collision layer to "1" and mask to "1" the block physics decide they enjoy working and you can toss those suckers.
</p>

<h3>
  2D Scene
</h3>
Controls:
<br>
-Arrow keys
<br>
<br>
<p>
  currently there is free 8 directional motion for the isometric view but im unsure if thats honestly a good thing for the block puzzle so that may be in the best interest to be limited if you wanna work on it.
